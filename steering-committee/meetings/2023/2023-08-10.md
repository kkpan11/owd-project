## Agenda

1. Announcements
    - New blog post: [https://openwebdocs.org/content/posts/micro-benevolences/](https://openwebdocs.org/content/posts/micro-benevolences/) ([toot - @yatil](https://yatil.social/@links/110867356920013260), [toot - @aardrian](https://toot.cafe/@aardrian/110866981222070368), [toot - @litherland](https://typo.social/@litherland/110866162887874839), my post on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/estelle.bsky.social/post/3k4n4hgyf3r2j)
    - In the news:
        - [Microsoft article](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2023/08/09/pwa-documentation-mdn-web-docs-open-web-docs/) ([toot](https://mas.to/@patrickbrosset/110867220843611912))
        - [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/what-does-it-mean-for-web-browsers-to-have-a-baseline/)
    - Almost all localize content is formatted with Prettier, only Japanese remains
        - This is the first step in a formatting/cleanup project led by Vinyl for localized content - remove outdated and untranslated, removed macros. After Japan, all translations will be prettified.
        - Hamish: If we maintain translations without tools, we will always be out of sync. We need to hand translate, not machine translate, but are we continuing or can we do something. Vinyl: more effort in making sure it’s in sync with upstream. A commit hash key has been introduced to track synchronization in front matter. Main issues come from wiki error. We are introducing scripts to keep translated in sync with upstream. Has been heavily discussed. The localized content teams are relatively small and they’re being asked, in essence, to maintain all of content, so it’s bound to get out of sync, but with tooling and the hash is should be faster and easier, and enables focusing on pages users want to see in their local. Will: its always been volunteer with no official product management oversight. No one has ever been paid to do that work. Hamish: when you go thru tooling change, often translators have to do all the update work. Will: this has happened a few times. Vinyl: doing the work on int’l under Moz contract. Moz doesn’t put much into it, but it is a very important part of MDN. we need to teach people in their own languages.
2. GC updates - most of GC is on vacation
3. Projects
    - [Embedding](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/174): working on extracting CSS formal syntax using webref/css (currently done in the csssyntax macro).
        - Will: build structured documentation that people can use to embed in their own apps and tools. Patrick talking to VSCode and Chrome dev tools. We should likely talk to jetbrains as well. Starting with a subset. Hamish: will this be presented with BCD information? Will: You always have to check compatibility. Estelle: baseline? Will: yes, baseline is likely machine readable. Hamish: so we’re not joining the two, but they’ll both be available. Dipika: something like [https://mastodon.social/@noleli/110855451830820485](https://mastodon.social/@noleli/110855451830820485)?  Will: yes, all comes from MDN or what MDN is pulling from (like webref) or stuff that isn’t in MDN if it is useful for tools. Though if it’s useful, it’s probably being pulled in. Dipikah: Some webref is outdated, like ray(). Estelle: do a PR for css drafts. Will: a module in our macro is currently outdated, but will be updated soon. So MDN is behind. MDN pages is not exposing the latest.
    - CSS Modules:
        - [CSS scoping](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/28354) (and [::slotted](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/28187/files) update)
            - Estelle: Complete!
        - [CSS font-loading](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/28379)
            - Estelle: Merged!
        - CSS fonts (current work)
            - New data types (&lt;[generic-family](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/28405)>, [absolute-size, relative-size](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/28461))
            - @font-feature-values [font-display descriptor](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/28500)
            - Estelle: Currently working on this.
        - [CSS anchor positioning](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/178)
            - Estelle: not supported, so not adding to /content/
        - Prior work: [CSS selectors](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/164), [CSS pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_pseudo-elements), and associated updates are live.
    - BCD
        - Cleaned up stale issues, issue count has gone from ~690 to 497
            - Vinyl:  and Vinyl have been cleaning up stale issues on BCD. Trying to ensure 100% accuracy and cleaning up unnecessary issues. Almost 200 issues closed. Hamish: answering current ones quickly has been super helpful. Thanks for looking at stuff that is inflow, not just the stale project.
        - Updating the mdn-bcd-collector to use proper tests for HTML/SVG elements and attributes
            - SVG is proving to be tricky
                - Vinyl: HTML all fixed. Just need to release it. SVG is much trickier. No IDL attributes that correlate. Trying to get an automated, maintainable method of documentation. Hamish: Not necessary to do a BCD because they’re in-sync with HTML? I don’t think so. Vinyl: no, you can’t mirror. SVG attributes are not the same as HTML attributes. We need all compat in one place. Don’t tell people to look elsewhere.
4. Other
    - Holidays
        - Florian August 17 until September 4.
        - Estelle: Sept 4 is labor day. Vacation Sept 5-8

    - Hamish is working on 117. Needs to write WebRTC code examples. Estelle: try reaching out to chris wilson at google to create a small app.that does one on one or group conversations to replace zoom. Patrick wrote a cycleTracker app, which i used as the basis for the PWA tutorial. Dipika: Zoom clarified. They’re not giving conversations to AI. That was a PR blunder.
