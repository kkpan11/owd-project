## Notes

- Microsoft wants to write a post about the PWA project. Estelle: her cycletracker post is not exactly about the project, more about the app itself; menstruation, privacy,.and building something useful when doing a tutorial. But we should have a post about the PWA project itself.
- Jean-Yves: project to go through WebIDL concepts and decide how they are documented. About 30 extended attributes. For each one, decide how it is reflected in the documentation, and then update the pages. Ideally a way to test it but may not have time in this project. Also types, including maplike/setlike and others.
- Embedding: Florian D is interested in collaborating on this, and feels it is a valuable thing. Cannot be written in JS if it is to be embeddable. Want to move into WebAssembly, but this is a long term goal.
- Ruth: Moving examples into content. Fewer repos is good, having examples beside content is good. We want to move examples into content but also consider how to improve them at the same time. Florian: would be a huge repo, and that is a worry. Ruth: can we not rush into this. Maybe some examples could become live samples and then would not be in separate repos anyway. Tldr: Mozilla is in favour of this but letâ€™s take it carefully.
