## Agenda

1. GC updates
2. Projects
    - Embedding
        - Need feedback! Is this helpful for VSCode (Patrick?)? Is it addressing what it needs to address (Florian)? Does the code make sense (Vinyl)?
    - CSS modules
        - Working on generated content
    - Glossary
3. Outside OWD Projects
    - Mozilla - no one present to report
    - Other - [WebRef](https://github.com/w3c/webref) [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webref/css)
4. Issues and discussions
    - PR reviews - we’re at 100. We should get under 60!
    - Macro renaming/case normalization: if you have opinion on naming macros, add them at [https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/448](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/448) 
    - Template for CSS functional notation: [https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/28953](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/28953) - things are called CSS functions if they have parentheses, but they’re not all like programmatic functions. The syntax of the parameters is very much NOT like programming languages (order, comma v space, slashes)
    - Is text-wrap ready to document? [https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/29065](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/29065) - the documentation, spec, and single implementation differ. When should we be documenting? &lt;fencedframe> is not in whatwg spec. In addition to a browser implementation, we should likely wait until the spec is no longer in flux before documenting.  
5. Announcements
    - Florian, Rachel, and Patrick are at TPAC. As is apparently the rest of the SC.
